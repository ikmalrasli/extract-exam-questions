                    types.Part.from_text(text="""These are the rules and schema which you will use to extract contents from provided exam question papers (PDF) later:
##GENERAL RULES##
- Avoid null values at ALL COSTS. If you have to use null value, use empty string instead.
- Each main_question, question, and sub-question consists of a number and a content_flow array.
- The JSON output must follow this format:
    - main_questions ‚Üí Top-level questions numbered \"1.\", \"2.\", \"3.\", etc.
    - questions ‚Üí Sub-questions numbered \"1(a)\", \"2(b)\", \"3(c)\", etc.
    - sub_questions ‚Üí Nested sub-questions \"1(a)(i)\", \"2(b)(ii)\", etc.
- OBESERVE CAREFULLY THE NUMBERING IN THE PDF.
- Every main_question must have questions.
- Not every question has sub_questions.
- Extract marks and add its key to their related questions/sub_questions.
- Every main_question, question, sub_question has a content_flow key.
- The content_flow array can contain any of the following in any order, **depending on how they appear in the PDF**:
    - \"text\": Contains question descriptions and instructions (in english and malay, segregated by \"english\" and \"malay\" keys respectively)
    - \"diagram\": Represents figures, charts, or illustrations.
    - \"table\": Represents tabular data extracted from the document.
    - \"row\": A multi-column layout for side-by-side diagrams or elements on the same row.
    - \"answer_space\": Represents the space given for writing down answers.
- Ensure the structure remains hierarchical:
    - Main questions (main_questions) should be nested under the top-level JSON object.
    - Questions (questions) array should be nested under their respective main_questions.
    - Sub-questions (sub_questions) array should be nested under their respective questions if applicable. (For questions that do not have sub_questions, do not add unnecessary sub_questions array)
    - Answer spaces (answer_space) should follow their related questions. **(Do not add answer spaces for Main Questions 9 to 11, this includes their respective nested questions and sub-questions)**
    - Maintain the original order of elements as they appear in the PDF.
- IMPORTANT - Page Break Handling:
    - Merge Across Pages: If a question or sub-question‚Äôs text appears to end on one page and continues on the next, combine the text from both pages into one complete content_flow element.
    - Ignore Page Markers: Treat page indicators (such as ‚Äúpage 1‚Äù, ‚Äúpage 2‚Äù, etc.) as formatting artifacts that should not interrupt the extraction of a single question‚Äôs content.
    - Overlapping Extraction: If the content at the end of a page appears incomplete (e.g., it ends in mid-sentence or mid-thought), look to merge it with the beginning of the subsequent page, ensuring that 
    continuation markers like ‚Äú(i)‚Äù for sub-questions are properly attached to the parent question.
- IMPORTANT - Reference Files:
    - Reference input and output files are given later in .pdf and .txt files respectively.
    - Reference outputs are given only for the following:
    ‚úÖ Understanding of JSON hierarchy
    ‚úÖ Recognizing how content_flow elements appear
    ‚úÖ Interpreting marks, diagrams, tables, etc.

    - Reference outputs are NOT to be used for:
    üö´ Generating any question text
    üö´ Reusing sentence structures
    üö´ Copying anything word-for-word

##GENERAL SCHEMA##
Guide to identify main questions:
- numbered \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", etc in **bold** font
- will always be in ascending order, and there will be no skips in the PDF. e.g. (1, 2, 3)
- do not skip any numbers (if you extract 1, 2, 4; you are wrong)
- Numbered \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", etc in the output JSON.

                ]
            },
        ]
    }
]
```

##CONTENT FLOW ELEMENTS##
- **Text**
    - Extract text and segregate into malay and english keys.
    - If there is a new line but within the same language, add a \\n
    - Example JSON object:
```json
{
    \"type\": \"text\",
    \"text\": {
        \"malay\": \"Apakah kesan negatif penggunaan tenaga hidroelektrik?\\nBerikan sebab\",
        \"english\": \"What are the negative impacts of using hydroelectric energy?\\nGive reasons.\"
    }
}
```

- **Diagram**
    - Represents figures, charts, or illustrations.
    - Only extract the diagram number and its PDF page number of appearance.
    - **DO NOT EXTRACT TEXT FROM DIAGRAM. Do not create text object from diagram.**
    - To identify diagram, every diagram will have a diagram number right below the diagram. e.g. "Rajah 1/Diagram 1", "Rajah 2", "Diagram 3", etc.
    - Typically has a text object before it that names and describes the diagram.
- Example JSON object:
```json
{
    \"type\": \"diagram\",
    \"number\": \"2.1\",
    \"page\": \"5\"
}
```

- **Table**
    - Represents tabular data extracted from the document.
    - Only extract the table number and its PDF page number of appearance.
    - **DO NOT EXTRACT TEXT FROM TABLE. Do not create text object from table.**
    - To identify table, every table will have a table number right below the table. e.g. "Jadual 1/Table 1", "Jadual 2", "Table 3", etc.
    - Typically has a text object before it that names and describes the table.
- Example JSON object:
```json
{
    \"type\": \"table\",
    \"number\": \"1\",
    \"page\": \"3\"
}
```

- Row
    - A multi-column layout for side-by-side diagrams or elements.
    - To identify row, look for diagrams/tables/text/answer_space that are horizontally aligned (visually).
    - The space between the items can be big or small
    - e.g. in a similar horizontal space, big space in between: "[diagram 1(a)]           [diagram 1(b)]"
    - e.g. in a similar horizontal space, small space in between: "[diagram 1(a)][diagram 1(b)]"
    - For Diagrams and Tables items, DO NOT EXTRACT TEXT FROM THEM. Do not create text object from them.
    - Extract the layout type and the items within the row.
    - Example 1 JSON object:
```json
{
    \"type\": \"row\",
    \"items\": [
        {
            \"type\": \"diagram\",
            \"number\": \"1.1\",
            \"page\": \"2\"
        },
        {
            \"type\": \"diagram\",
            \"number\": \"1.2\",
            \"page\": \"2\"
        }
    ]
}
```

    - Example 2 JSON object:
```json
{
    \"type\": \"row\",
    \"items\": [
        {
            \"type\": \"text\",
            \"text\": {
                \"malay\": \"Zarah alfa:\",
                \"english\": \"Alpha particle:\"
            }
        },
        {
            \"type\": \"answer_space\",
            \"format\": \"line\",
            \"lines\": 1
        },
        {
            \"type\": \"text\",
            \"text\": {
                \"malay\": \"Zarah beta:\",
                \"english\": \"Beta particle:\"
            }
        },
        {
            \"type\": \"answer_space\",
            \"format\": \"line\",
            \"lines\": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

- **Answer Space**
    - Represents the space given for writing down answers.
    - Extract only what you can see from the PDF. Do not add additional info.
    - Extract the format, number of lines, and options if applicable.
    - **Answer Space DOES NOT apply to Main Questions 9 to 11, including their respective nested questions and sub-questions.**
    - There are three formats: line, multiple-choice, and blank-space.
    a. Line
        - Illustrates the number of dotted-horizontal lines given for writing the answer.
        - To identify line visually, it is usually a long set of dots e.g. "............................"
        - If visually there are two lines of dots e.g. "............................\n............................", then that is 2 lines.
        - Add a \"line\" key to the answer_space type element for line formats to represent the number of lines.
        - Example JSON object:
    ```json
    {
        \"type\": \"answer_space\",
        \"format\": \"line\",
        \"lines\": <Number of lines>
    }
    ```

    b. Blank Space
        - Represents a blank space for answers.
        - A blank space is determined by visually identifying the space given from the question text and the marks allocator.
        - Typically for questions that involve calculations.
        - Example JSON object:
    ```json
    {
        \"type\": \"answer_space\",
        \"format\": \"blank-space\"
    }

    c. Multiple-Choice
    - Represents a multiple-choice question that requires the user to select/tick the correct answer from a set of predetermined options.
    - To identify multiple-choice answer space, visually look for boxes or tables that require the user to ticking them.
    - Add an \"options\" key to represent the predetermined options.
    - Extract the options in both Malay and English.
    - Example JSON object:
    ```json
    {
        \"type\": \"answer_space\",
        \"format\": \"multiple-choice\",
        \"options\": [
            {
                \"malay\": \"spektrum garis\",
                \"english\": \"line spectrum\"
            },
            {
                \"malay\": \"spektrum selanjar\",
                \"english\": \"continuous spectrum\"
            }
        ]
    }

- **JSON Structure:**  Maintaining the correct hierarchical structure with `main_questions`, `questions`, and `sub_questions`.
- **Numbering:**  Following the correct numbering sequence for each question type and avoiding skips.
- **Content Flow:**  Accurately extracting and categorizing content into `text`, `diagram`, `table`, `row`, and `answer_space` elements, including segregating text by language.
- **Page Breaks:**  Handling page breaks by merging content that spans across multiple pages.
- **Marks:**  Associating marks with their respective questions and sub-questions.
- **Answer Spaces:**  Correctly identifying and representing different answer space formats (`line`, `multiple-choice`, `blank-space`) and including options for multiple-choice questions.
- **Ignoring Page Markers:**  Avoiding the inclusion of page numbers or other page-related artifacts in the extracted content.
- **Avoiding Text Extraction from Diagrams and Tables:** Only extracting the diagram/table number and page number.
- **No Answer Spaces for Main Questions 9 to 11:** Excluding answer spaces for main questions 9 to 11 and all their sub-questions.

I will use the provided example JSON snippets as a guide for structuring the output, but I will generate the actual question text, sentence structures, etc., directly from the PDF content.
