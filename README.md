A web-based tool to streamline teachers' workflow by extracting questions, diagrams, and tables from exam PDFs into editable DOCX files.

Inspiration:
This project was inspired by the tedious process teachers (like my mother, a physics teacher) face when creating exam papers. Typically, they:

Refer to past or external exam papers (often in PDF format).

Manually copy-paste or retype questions, diagrams, and tables into a Word documentâ€”a time-consuming and error-prone task.

The Problem:
Many exam papers are in rasterized or text-based PDFs, making extraction difficult.

Copying content preserving formatting (text, diagrams, tables) is a hassle.

Adjusting margins and layouts in Word adds unnecessary effort.

The Solution:
This tool automates the extraction process:
âœ… Upload an exam PDF (scanned or digital).
âœ… Extract questions, diagrams, and tables with structured formatting.
âœ… Download a ready-to-use DOCX file, formatted like a standard exam paper.

Impact: Saves hours of manual work, letting teachers focus on teachingâ€”not document formatting!

Key Features
Supports rasterized and text-based PDFs.

Preserves tables, diagrams, and text layout.
